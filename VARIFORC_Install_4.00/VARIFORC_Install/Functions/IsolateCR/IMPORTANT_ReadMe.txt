IMPORTANT INFORMATION!

The parameter file VARIFORC_IsolateCR_parameters.txt contains default options that work with most FORC matrices.
Options should be adapted to specific cases for best performances: see the VARIFORC User Manual and the VARIFORC Quick Guide.

In particular, the Hc- and Hb- ranges of the seed vertical profile (INPUT 01 and INPUT 02) as well as the maximum
freedom degree of the central ridge model should me modified in case of unsatisfactory results related to large
measurement errors.
